# From Best Practices to Research Methodology

Good research isn’t just about the right model or dataset—it’s about building a system where your entire process is transparent, reproducible, and scalable. We’re not just replacing tools; we’re redefining methodology

| Traditional Best Practice           | Modern Methodological Approach           |
|:------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| High-dimensional statistics         | Machine learning                         |
| Inline code comments                | Literate programming (Notebooks: Rmd, Jupyter) |
| `mydoc_1_3_new_final_23.docx`       | Version control (Git, GitHub/GitLab)     |
| Manually curated Excel tables       | Programmatically generated tables (SQL, dplyr, pandas) |
| Ad hoc scripts and file sharing     | Fully reproducible workflows (e.g., Make, Snakemake, R targets) |
| Stata, SAS, EViews                  | R, Python, Julia                         |
| Working in isolation                | Interdisciplinary, collaborative teams   |

# Why This Matters

Modern research demands more than good analysis.

✅ Transparent  
✅ Reproducible  
✅ Collaborative  
✅ Scalable

We're moving from ad hoc habits to **engineered workflows**.  
Not just new tools — a new **research methodology**.

# Reproducibility: From Principle to Practice

**Reproducible research**  
Enables *anyone* — including future-you — to re-run your code and get the same results.

**What it requires:**  
- Clear documentation (what you did *and* why)  
- All dependencies listed (packages, versions, data sources)  
- Environment details (e.g., R version, OS, random seeds)  

**Mindset shift:**  
Write for the *next person* who reads your code — especially if that person is you, six months from now.

.pull-right[

- **[`renv` package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html):** Create reproducible environments for R projects

- **Key benefits:**

  - *Isolated:* Private package library for each project
  - *Portable:* Easily transfer projects across computers and platforms
  - *Reproducible:* Records exact package versions for consistent installations

# RStudio Project-Oriented Workflow

**Avoid common anti-patterns:**
- `setwd()` — hardcodes paths and breaks portability
- `rm(list = ls())` — hides underlying issues in code structure

**Recommended practices:**

1. Use RStudio Projects  
   - Keeps all files relative to a self-contained working directory  
   - Supports portability and collaboration

2. Configure your R environment for reproducibility  
   - Go to: `Tools → Global Options → General`  
   - Set **“Save workspace to .RData on exit”** to **NEVER**  
   - Uncheck **“Restore .RData into workspace at startup”**

---
# Why Project-Oriented Workflows Matter

**1. Reproducibility**  
Your code should run from start to finish on any machine, with no manual tweaks.

**2. Transparency**  
Avoid hidden state and side effects — make your logic explicit and inspectable.

**3. Portability**  
Relative paths and project directories ensure your work is easily shared or moved.

**4. Collaboration**  
Team members (and your future self) can understand and run your project without reverse-engineering your environment.

**5. Version control compatibility**  
Project-based organization plays well with Git, enabling clean tracking of changes and smooth collaboration.

# R Markdown: A Tool for Reproducible Research

- Integrates text, code, figures, tables, and citations in one document  

- Always starts from a clean R session when “knitted” — ensures reproducibility
- Outputs to multiple formats:
  - Documents: HTML, PDF, Word
  - Presentations: Beamer, PowerPoint, Xaringan
  - Websites, books, articles, dashboards (`blogdown`, `bookdown`, `pagedown`, `flexdashboard`)

- Ideal for communicating analysis, sharing workflows, and creating dynamic documents

- A modern alternative: [**Quarto**](https://quarto.org)  
  - Supports R, Python, Julia; more flexible and extensible

# The Tidyverse

# This is Not a Pipe

```{r pipe, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("figs/pipe.jpg")

```


---

# `%>%` Is a Pipe

- `%>%` is the *pipe operator* from the `magrittr` package (core to the `tidyverse`)
- It passes the result of one function into the next — like saying **“and then”**

**Example (equivalent code):**

Traditional:
`y <- h(g(f(x), z))`

Piped version:
`y <- x %>% f() %>% g(z) %>% h()`

**Read as:**
“Take `x`, then apply `f()`, then apply `g()` with `z`, then apply `h()` — save as `y`”

This expresses a series of transformations **in the order you think about them**, improving both readability and debugging.

# Morning Routine

```{r pipe2, echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("figs/pipe2.png")

```

# Base R vs. the Tidyverse

Given this data frame:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  x = rnorm(10),
  y = rnorm(10),
  z = rnorm(10)
)
```
What does this base R code do?

```{r}
df_new <- df[df$x > 0, c("x", "y")]
df_new$xx <- df_new$x^2
```

Next: Let’s rewrite this with `dplyr` for clarity and readability.

---

# "Pipped" code?

How about this one?

```{r }
df_new <- df %>% 
  select(x, y) %>% 
  filter(x > 0) %>% 
  mutate(xx = x^2)
```


The above code chunk should be read as:

>"Take `df`, then select `x` and `y`, then keep rows where `x > 0`, then add a new column `xx = x^2`."

- The native pipe operator `|>` is available in R 4.1.0 and later

```{r }
df_new <- df |>  
  select(x, y) |> 
  filter(x > 0) |> 
  mutate(xx = x^2)
```

---
# Pros & Cons

- Adopting a **tidyverse** approach improves readability ⇒ and with it, **reproducibility**

- There’s a growing consensus in the R community that we should [**learn the tidyverse first**](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/)

- But: the tidyverse is **utopian by design** - It evolves rapidly in pursuit of elegance and consistency

- Base R, by contrast, is **stable and enduring** - Built to last — sometimes clunky, but reliable

- **Bottom line:** Be fluent in both — tidy tools for clarity, base tools for durability

# Vibe Coding

- **What is Vibe Coding?**  A term popularized by Andrej Karpathy, *vibe coding* is the practice of using natural language to prompt AI tools to generate code — letting you focus on "what" rather than "how."

- **How it works:**
  - Describe what you want in plain language
  - Let an AI assistant (like ChatGPT) generate the code
  - Test, refine, and adapt the output to fit your goals

- **Connection to Reproducibility:**
  - Pros: Accelerates the creation of reproducible scripts and pipelines  
  - Cons: Risks introducing opaque, unvalidated code if you're not critically engaged

- **Takeaway:**  Vibe coding is powerful — but only if paired with a solid understanding of workflows, data, and reproducibility principles. *Don’t just vibe — validate.*

# Tidyverse Packages

Which packages come with `tidyverse`?

```{r }

tidyverse_packages()

```

Note that not all these packages are loaded by default.

We now briefly introduce the tidyverse's flagship: `dplyr`.

---
# `dplyr`: The Grammar of Data Manipulation

**`dplyr` is the tidyverse toolkit for transforming data frames**  
Readable, consistent, and designed for pipelines.

**Core verbs:**
- `filter()` – keep rows that meet a condition  
- `select()` – pick columns by name  
- `mutate()` – add or transform columns  
- `arrange()` – sort rows  
- `summarise()` – reduce values to summaries

**Additional verbs:**
- `group_by()` – perform operations by group  
- `sample_n()` – randomly sample rows

[Complete `dplyr` reference ](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html)

# The `tidymodels` package

- Tidymodels extends the tidyverse's "grammar" to modeling tasks.

```{r tidymodels}
tidymodels::tidymodels_packages()
```

### The "*_FINAL_v2_REALLY_FINAL_THIS_TIME.xlsx*" problem:

- What exactly changed?
- Where in the file?
- When was it edited?
- Who made the change?
- Why was it changed?

- **Git** is a *distributed version control system*.

- Sounds fancy? Think **"track changes"**, but for entire code projects.

- Git tracks every change, by every contributor, across time.

- It's the **de facto standard** for managing code, collaborating, and ensuring reproducibility.

- Git isn't just for code — it's used to track any plain text files. It's a foundational tool for reproducible research

- GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories.

- It’s like Dropbox for Git projects — but with features for collaboration, issue tracking, and code review.

- GitHub builds on Git by making it easier to work with others and manage projects online.

- It's a key hub for open-source development, including many R packages and research tools.
