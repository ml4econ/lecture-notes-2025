## Overview

This course integrates data science, machine learning, and econometrics to equip students with fundamental machine learning concepts that can enhance empirical economics research. Students will explore both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, with emphasis on their applications in empirical economics. The course highlights the relevance of machine learning to policy analysis and causal inference through real-world applications, empirical research papers, and hands-on assignments.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Implement data science best practices within empirical economics research
2. Navigate the challenges and opportunities of working with high-dimensional data in economics
3. Integrate machine learning techniques into applied economic research

## Prerequisites

Students are expected to:

1. Have their own computers with R, RStudio (Posit), Git, and GitHub Desktop installed
2. Create free accounts on GitHub and Kaggle
