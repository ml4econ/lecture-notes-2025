# An aside: about the structure of these slides

- The course's slide decks are created using the [xaringan](https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#44) (/ʃæ.'riŋ.ɡæn/) R package and [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

- Some slides include hidden comments. To view them, press __p__ on your keyboard

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align='center'}

# About the Course

---
# Prerequisites

Econometrics
- Linear regression models and OLS estimation
- Statistical inference and hypothesis testing
- Endogeneity issues and instrumental variables

Mathematical Foundation
- Derivatives, partial derivatives, and basic optimization
- Matrices, vectors, eigenvalues/eigenvectors
- Random variables, probability distributions,expectations, Sampling distributions

Programming
- Some experience with R (or another programming language) is a plus
- Basic data manipulation and visualization skills
- Familiarity with statistical software packages

---
# Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Apply machine learning methods to economic research problems, including prediction policy tasks and causal inference questions

- Implement and evaluate ML workflows with proper cross-validation, regularization, and model selection techniques

- Interpret ML results in economic contexts and understand when ML approaches complement or improve upon traditional econometric methods

---
# What This Course Is NOT About

This course deliberately excludes:

- Technical implementation details of advanced ML algorithms (we focus on application rather than algorithmic development)

- Deep theoretical foundations of ML methods (we emphasize practical understanding over mathematical proofs)

- Cutting-edge techniques like generative AI, reinforcement learning, or computer vision (we concentrate on established methods with proven economic applications)

# Programming


* Two of the most popular open-source programming languages for data science:  

  - [<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>](https://www.r-project.org/)  
  
  - [<i class="fab fa-python"></i> Python](https://www.python.org/)  

* This course: Mostly R. Why? 
  - Widely used in academia.  
  - Great for data manipulation and visualization.  
  - Excellent for econometrics.  
  - Great for machine learning.  
  - Great for reproducibility.

*  We do encourage you to try out Python. However, **I** will only be able to provide limited support for Python users. Inbar on the other hand, will be able to provide more support.

# Catching up with R

If you are new to R, here are some resources to get you started:

* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is a great book to learn R and data science.

* [Posit Recipes](https://posit.cloud/learn/recipes) is a great (old school) resource to learn R.

* [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) is a great resource to learn R (and Python).

# GenAI

We encourage you to use AI (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) in this course, as it is an **essential skill to acquire**.

It is important you understand the (current) limitations of AI and its implications for economic research:

- Prompt engineering is necessary for quality outcomes.
- Always assume that it is wrong.
- Acknowledge its use in assignments and explain what prompts were used.

A useful resources:

- Read ["Generative AI for Economic Research: Use Cases and Implications for Economists"](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20231736) by Korinek (2023 JEL). Check for the latest version.

# Grading

Assignments:

- Submit 4 out of a total of 6 Problem sets.


Two projects: 

- Kaggle prediction competition.

- Conduct a replication study based on one of the datasets included in the [experimentdatar](https://itamarcaspi.github.io/experimentdatar/) package, or a paper of your choice.

???

* One of your tasks in this course will be a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) competition. In this competition, you will rely on the “Boston Housing Data” to train and test machine learning models learned in the course. In particular, you will be required to apply the tools introduced in the course in order to predict ... [website](https://www.kaggle.com/t/97eb0edcbe7c406882c7c067076bedd3).
